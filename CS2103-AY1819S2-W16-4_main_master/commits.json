It has the options: fiter and, filter or, filter clear. - User Guide is updated with the addition of fiter command explanation. - The necessary methods for filtering to take place are added in the AddressBook.java, Model.java and ModelManager.java classes - A size returning function is created in the UniquePersonList.java class - Instead of having only one person list in the addressbook, a second person list is created and implemented for every single method. It is necessary because when one list holds every contact information and the other list holds the filtered contacts to be showed. - TODO: filtering is not working well with undo and redo operations. This will be implemented. - TODO: a command remove-filtered-contacts will be added to remove all the filtered contacts at once.",
